## Installation

### Step 1: Download and Install Python 3.11+

Ensure you have Python version 3.11 or higher installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Download and Extract the Tool

Download the tool and extract it from the zip file.

### Step 3: Finish the setup in the panel

Execute `setup.bat`. When prompted, type 'y' to complete the setup process. Please be aware that the setup may take at least 40 seconds due to code obfuscation and the download of the ChromeDriver which will be used with certain features.
(the finishsetup.py file will delete itself after downloading every module and chromedriver.exe soo there would be less chance to mess up the setup)

### Step 4: Start the GUI

Run `start.bat` to open the GUI. When you see the setup page, ignore it and type `>`. This will take you to the feature page.

Note: During the installation process, Discord may reboot due to Python installation or the addition of a Discord module.
